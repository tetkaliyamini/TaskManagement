# Self-Evaluation

## Summary
I built a Task Management Dashboard with a Kanban-style board, allowing users to create, view, and move tasks between columns. The project integrates with a mock API to persist tasks and supports drag-and-drop functionality. The UI is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Self-Criticism
- The drag-and-drop functionality could be more robust, especially for edge cases (e.g., dropping a task outside a valid column).
- Error handling for API calls is minimal and could be improved.
- The code could be more modular, especially the components responsible for rendering tasks.

## Improvements
If I had more time, I would:
- Add task editing and deletion features.
- Improve error handling and user feedback for API calls.
- Implement animations for smoother drag-and-drop interactions.
- Write unit tests to ensure reliability.

## Technology Rating
- React: 8/10 (I used hooks effectively but could improve on context management.)
- JavaScript: 9/10 (I wrote clean and functional code but could optimize performance.)
- CSS: 7/10 (I used basic CSS but could explore a library like TailwindCSS for better scalability.)
